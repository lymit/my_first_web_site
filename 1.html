<h2>What is Set Theory?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory"
target="_blank" title="wikipedia : Set_theory">Set theory</a> is 
<strong>branch of mathematical logic studies 
    <u>sets</u>
</strong>
, which can be informally described as collections of objects.
 Although objects of any kind can be collected into a set,
  set theory, as a branch of mathematics,
   is mostly concerned with those 
   that are relevant to mathematics as a whole.

The modern study of set theory was initiated 
by the German mathematicians Richard Dedekind 
and Georg Cantor in the 1870s. In particular, 
Georg Cantor is commonly considered the founder of set theory. 
The non-formalized systems investigated during this early stage 
go under the name of naive set theory. 
After the discovery of paradoxes within naive set theory 
(such as Russell's paradox, Cantor's paradox 
and the Burali-Forti paradox), various axiomatic systems were 
proposed in the early twentieth century, of which 
Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of 
choice) is still the best-known and most studied.
