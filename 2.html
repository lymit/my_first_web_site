<h2>Linear algebra</h2>
<p>
    Linear algebra is central to almost 
    all areas of mathematics. For instance,
     linear algebra is fundamental in modern
      presentations of geometry, including 
      for defining basic objects such as 
      lines, planes and rotations. Also, 
      functional analysis, a branch of 
      mathematical analysis, may be
       viewed as the application of 
       linear algebra to spaces of functions.
